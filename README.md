# .vim

My .vimrc file for use.

## Packages included
- git-open - this package allows you to open the a github repository in github by typing 'git open' in the repo you are in

Personal Notes/Tricks:

Use ctags to get function definations. 
See https://andrew.stwrt.ca/posts/vim-ctags/

First you need to download ctags and put the command in the PATH.
Then run ctags .
Then use CTRL + ] to go to a function defination.
